"""Event-driven Cloud LLM replanning trigger for DACA-HMAS.

Design principle
-----------------
The Cloud LLM (task decomposition + coalition formation) should only be
re-consulted when the *state it reasoned over* has materially changed in a
way that makes the currently stored plan provably invalid or incomplete.
A fixed replanning interval or a CQI-threshold trigger are both policy
choices about *when it is convenient* to refresh the plan, independent of
whether the existing plan is still correct -- neither is used here.

Every trigger below is a correctness condition: if it fires, continuing to
execute the stored plan would either (a) ignore new mission scope, (b)
leave freed agent capacity idle, or (c) execute an assignment that is no
longer feasible. If none fire, the stored plan is still a valid answer to
the same planning problem the Cloud LLM already solved, so re-asking it
would return an equivalent result at the cost of an API call.
