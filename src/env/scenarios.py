"""Mission scenario definitions (logistics, inspection, search_rescue).

Scenario semantics are derived from AutoHMA-LLM Section V-A:
- Logistics: warehouse/distribution with UAVs, vehicles, warehouse robots;
  environment includes 5-60% lane occupancy from background traffic.
- Inspection: facility inspection with UAVs (aerial patrol), inspection robots
  (ground mobile), and sensors (fixed at a specific location);
  10% communication delay, 1% terminal data loss.
- Search & Rescue: maritime SAR with UAVs (aerial search), ships (maritime
  rescue assets), and rescue robots (extraction); rough-sea, irregular-wind
  environment (qualitative only — no implementable physics model given).
